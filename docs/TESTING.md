# Testing airShot

## Workstation

airShot is built and tested on the X399 Haiku workstation (192.168.1.244):

- `tools/ws.sh '<command>'` runs a command there over SSH.
- `tools/sync-build.sh [target]` syncs the tree to `/boot/home/airshot` and
  runs `make` there, printing errors only.
- `tools/install-dev.sh [--run]` installs the filter into
  `~/config/non-packaged/add-ons/input_server/filters/airShot` and the app into
  `~/config/non-packaged/apps/airShot`, optionally starting it.
- `tools/sync-build.sh package` builds the hpkg in `artifacts/`;
  `pkgman install -y <hpkg>` installs it (bump the version first when
  reinstalling). Remove a dev install first (`desklink --remove=airShot`, the
  files under `~/config/non-packaged`), or two filters will be loaded.
- `tools/build-cross.sh` cross-compiles on Linux with the x399 Haiku build
  tree, for quick compile checks when the workstation is unreachable.

The workstation's VNC server (port 5900) injects input through the
`InputEventInjector` device, so keystrokes sent over VNC pass through
`input_server` and therefore through the shortcut filter, which makes the
shortcuts testable remotely:

```
python3 tools/vnc.py shot out.png --scale 0.5     # screenshot
python3 tools/vnc.py key 0xFF61                    # Print Screen
python3 tools/vnc.py click X Y / drag X0 Y0 X1 Y1 / type "text"
```

The NanoKVM at 192.168.1.22 can send real USB keyboard events as a second
path (`/mnt/HaikuWork/x399/tools/kvm.py`).

`tools/vnc-script.sh` runs a list of `vnc.py` commands (one per line, with
`shot NAME X,Y,W,H` and `full NAME SCALE` for captures). Start the app with
`AIRSHOT_TRACE=1` (what `tools/install-dev.sh --run` does) to get message and
overlay traces in `/boot/home/airshot/app.log`; `touch /boot/home/airshot/.trace`
makes the filter log every key press and dispatch to the syslog. The
workstation's `debug_server` is set to write crash reports for airShot to the
Desktop without a dialog (`~/config/settings/system/debug_server/settings`).

Note that the VNC server (and `BScreen::GetBitmap`) did not show the overlay
window at all while a Summit GL benchmark was running, and a user working at
the physical display sees and reacts to every test capture; keep interactive
tests short.

## Unit tests

`make BUILD=build-host check-host` on Linux (or `make check` on Haiku) runs
`tests/HotKeyTests.cpp`: shortcut matching, labels and key names.

## Capture startup timing

Run airShot with `AIRSHOT_TRACE=1` to log monotonic timestamps for the capture
request, hiding its windows, screen readback, window enumeration and showing
the overlay. Compare `requested` with `overlay shown` with the capture delay
set to zero. The 250 ms window-settle delay and the 150 ms cursor-hide delay
are intentional; a multi-second gap at `grabbing screen` is in screen readback.

`make capture-timing` builds a native probe using the same `GrabScreen` path.
Run `build-haiku/capture_timing` to measure six captures, alternating cursor
inclusion, and validate their dimensions. An optional limit in milliseconds
turns it into a performance regression check, for example
`build-haiku/capture_timing 1000` on X399. The limit is machine-dependent and
is deliberately separate from the portable unit tests.

Issue #1 was traced to `DrawingEngine::ReadBitmap` in X399's Haiku fork: at
200% display density it read the 7680x2160 GPU front buffer before downsampling
to 3840x1080. The fix belongs in Haiku's app_server: use the drawing buffer in
RAM at non-native density, where direct windows are disconnected and the
drawing buffer holds the complete desktop. At native density the front
buffer remains necessary to include direct-window rendering. Updating airShot
alone does not fix this OS bottleneck.

## Manual checklist

1. Print Screen with nothing running: airShot starts and opens the editor
   with the full screen.
2. Shift+Print Screen: overlay in window mode; hovering moves the highlight
   with an animation; clicking captures the window (tab included, corners
   transparent); dragging switches to a region.
3. Ctrl+Print Screen: crosshair, drag a region, adjust with handles, Enter.
4. Editor: every tool, undo/redo, zoom (Alt+wheel), Save (notification and
   file in the configured folder), Copy (paste into another app).
5. Settings: record a new shortcut (the old one must not fire while
   recording), change the save folder, toggle the Deskbar icon.
6. Deskbar icon menu: captures, open, settings, quit.
7. `airShot picture.png` opens the file in the editor.
